# UPC-2022-2023
Solutions for the UPC 2022-2023 Problem Set.  
The University Programming Contest (UPC) is a contest held annually for programming in the University of Sharjah.  
In the 2022-2023 contest, I was able to get first place, solving 8 out of 9 problems. I was unable to solve the "Super Knight" problem in the allocated time. However, I have included my attempted solution, as well as valid solutions from the 2nd Place and 3rd Place.
